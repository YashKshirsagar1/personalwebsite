    <h1>Yash Kshirsagar</h1>
    <h2>I'm Yash, currently a student at Eastside Preparatory School, and I love figuring out the story and insights from messy data.
        One interesting fact is that I love writing and discussing about current events, the economy, and where the value is shifting in the world. Turns out, being data-oriented has aided me in this pursuit tremendously.</h2>
